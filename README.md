fuck you firebase. that's all i have to say

ok
well
so

i finally got around to doing it, i re'ed how we feel. i tried before and kept failing (because i fucking hate reading smali code)

but basically i decompiled how we feel to figure out how its done, and holy shit its simple lmao, its just a frontend for firebase, like, thats literally it

oh yeah, by the way, this code is in NO WAY READY FOR PRODUCTION. all of this code is really REALLY jank, you should wait until i make a full tutorial on how to use/set it up, and i've cleaned up the code

ok thx bye
